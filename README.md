## Flask Application Design

### Problem Analysis
To design an application that suggests ideas for viral Instagram reels based on a topic, we'll leverage Flask's capabilities to create a user-friendly interface and efficient backend processing.

### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: This is the landing page of the application. It will contain a form to collect the topic from the user. The form will have a text input field where the user can type in the topic they want to generate ideas for. The form will submit to the "/generate" route.

2. **results.html**: This file will be responsible for displaying the ideas generated by the application. It will receive the topic from the "/generate" route and use that to display a list of ideas.

### Routes

1. **"/generate"**: This is the route that will handle the form submission from the index.html page. It will take the topic submitted by the user and pass it to a function that will generate ideas. The generated ideas will then be rendered in the results.html page.

2. **"/about"**: This is an optional route that can be used to display information about the application, such as its purpose and creators.

### Conclusion
This Flask application design enables you to create an interactive tool that assists users in brainstorming and generating engaging Instagram reel ideas. Remember to customize the HTML templates and implement the logic in the routes to suit your specific requirements.
